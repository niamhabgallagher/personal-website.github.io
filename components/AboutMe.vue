                        I'm a front end web developer at vTime in the Baltic Triangle area of 
                        Liverpool. I have over 3 years experience working with Nuxt and Vue 
                        technologies.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I've worked in the Baltic Triangle the whole time I have lived in 
                        Liverpool, in the same building! First for The Baltic Social and 
                        then I moved upstairs to vTime!

                        In October 2023 I founded <i>'Women in Tech Liverpool'</i> a 
                        community for women in the tech industry in Liverpool and 
                        surrounding areas.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I founded this community because it was something that I was looking 
                        for when I was at uni and first started my career and it wasn't available.
                        I organise events like coffee mornings, event nights and co-working spaces!

                        In my spare time I really enjoy crocheting. I have been crocheting for
                        about 4 years now and have made so many fun things. I started off making
                        teddy's and plushies but now I make snoods for dogs, baby blankets and handbags.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I have also made some cool commissions, I have made a few ski masks for a local
                        musician in Liverpool!

                        Another big part of my life is my dog Soup! He is a two year old 
                        whippet and has the biggest personality.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Soup comes to work with me every Wednesday, meets up with his friends 
                        every Sunday and must visit his favourite coffee shops for his pup cup!
                        <br/><br/>
                        Soup also has his name in the credits of Border Bots VR (and so do I)
